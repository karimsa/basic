# basic

Basic computer from CEG2136. Created by me in an attempt to study for my exam by coding out the content.

It is capable of executing the simple instructions on a 16-bit architecture consisting of an ALU + CU and a data bus. It is similar to our lab 4 assignment but it is written in go rather than with the Altera Quartus platform.

## Usage

Grab it via `go get github.com/karimsa/basic`.

*More instructions coming.*

## Architecture

### Registers

The CPU has 9 registers and a 4096x16 memory unit. The breakdown is from the lecture slides:
